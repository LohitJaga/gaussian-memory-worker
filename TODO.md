# Gaussian Memory — TODO

## Ship Goal — July 1 2026
BYOC model: users deploy to their own Cloudflare account, pay their own $5/month, own their data.
Open source + blog post + one-command setup. Not commercial, not hosted.

## Thesis
**The memory layer for any agent or any LLM — including eve.**
eve (and every agent framework) ships execution, sandbox, orchestration, tracing — but
*no persistent semantic memory*. That gap is the whole product. Don't compete on agent
infrastructure; be the portable, vendor-neutral memory layer that plugs into all of them.
Differentiators: Bayesian/Gaussian uncertainty (memories sharpen/decay), cross-session +
cross-LLM ground truth, edge-native BYOC.

## Decay / Cron — ROOT CAUSE FOUND (2026-06-18)
**The nightly cron is silently broken — this is why decay "doesn't work" and cold/old junk piles up.**
Investigated 2026-06-18. `memory_sigma_history` has ZERO `decay`/`prune` events ever; 645 prunable
(σ>1.8) rows and 358 cold-archive-eligible rows are still sitting in D1 un-touched.
- **Root cause:** `scheduled()` (index.ts:146-154) calls `consolidateColdMemories` and `updateDecay`,
  each wrapped in `.catch(() => {})`. Both do **unbounded full-table scans** (`SELECT ... FROM memories`
  with no LIMIT over ~4.6k rows) → time out / `D1_ERROR: overloaded` → error swallowed → 0 work done,
  no log. The e2e `decay` test reproduces the timeout.
- [x] **Fixed the cron failure (verified in code, 2026-07-05):** `updateDecay` (cron.ts:15-20) now
      bounded to `LIMIT 500` ordered by `access_count, timestamp`; `consolidateColdMemories`
      (cron.ts:389-396) bounded to `LIMIT 200`. `scheduled()` (index.ts:194-214) wraps every cron job
      in a named `run()` helper that logs failures via `console.error` instead of swallowing them.
- [x] **R2 cold-archive undo path — confirmed live (2026-07-05):** `consolidateColdMemories`
      (cron.ts:387-460) archives to R2 then deletes from D1/Vectorize; runs on the now-bounded scan
      so it actually executes on every cron tick instead of timing out first.
- [x] **No deletion audit log — fixed (2026-07-05):** `memory_delete` (tools.ts:1109-1141) and
      `memory_bulk_delete` (tools.ts:1305-1350) now archive each memory to R2 at `memories/{id}.json`
      (same shape as `consolidateColdMemories`) before hard-deleting from D1/Vectorize; R2 write
      failures are caught and logged but never block the delete.
- [x] **Verified the retrieval problem exists + fixed it (2026-06-18):** ran real retrievals — cold
      verbatim junk WAS surfacing (chat-speak at 1.5+). Fixed via MMR dedup + session/recency rebalance
      (retrieval) + a one-time cleanup of the junk (see Done 2026-06-18). Retrieval is now clean.
- [x] **Soft-forget decay — implemented, not the exact prescribed formula (confirmed 2026-07-05):**
      cron.ts:27 uses `stability = 1 + ln(access_count+1)` to scale the decay delta (matches the S0
      shape), plus an explicit 3x penalty for cold-stale rows (access_count=0, >7d old, cron.ts:30-34).
      Not the literal `R = exp(-Δt/S)` exponential-retention formula from the plan, but functionally
      addresses "flat decay doesn't account for reinforcement." Revisit only if this approximation
      turns out to prune wrong in practice.
- Sim done 2026-06-17: S0=5→prune 2422(46%), S0=7→1825(35%), S0=10→636(12%,all cold).
- Corpus size note: domain rebuild logged 5,244 on 2026-06-17; 5,170 at session start 2026-06-18
  (backup-proven); 4,608 after today's cleanup. No bulk deletion found yesterday (git Jun 17 = extension
  work only; decay never ran). The ~74 Jun17→Jun18 drift is merges/small deletes — unverifiable (no audit log).

## Priority 1 — Do before July 1 (the actual ship)

### Packaging (the real gap — building is mostly done, this isn't)
- [x] One-command setup (`npx gaussian-memory init`) — confirmed 2026-07-05: README documents full
      flow (D1/Vectorize/KV creation, wrangler.toml patch, migrations, deploy, AUTH_TOKEN secret,
      `~/.gaussian-memory-env`, Claude Code + Zed hook auto-config). Git history shows 2 rounds of
      "fix init crash on fresh clone" — exercised against fresh clones, not just the original deploy.
- [ ] Verify a fresh end-to-end install works on a genuinely separate stranger's Cloudflare account
      (fresh-clone testing so far has been on your own account/machine — not the same test). Needs
      a second Cloudflare account to actually exercise — not something a coding session can do alone.
- [x] README: thesis + differentiator present ("What it does" + "Why not just RAG?"), architecture
      diagram present (Mermaid flowchart + component table, commit `51b3cc2`). Competitor
      comparison table was added (`51b3cc2`/`279cdd5`) then **deliberately removed** in `0be2a28`
      ("cut AI-cadence tells" — read as too marketing-y next to the rest of the README's grounded
      tone) — this checkbox was stale, not actually missing.
- [x] One-line pitch + hard numbers — added 2026-07-23: intro now states 87%/83% recall
      (main+multihop/vague, k=8) vs 67%/58% baseline, with the honest token-cost tradeoff (3.6–7.5x),
      sourced from the frozen benchmark. See BENCHMARKING.md's 2026-07-23 session logs for the run.

### Benchmarking (need numbers for README/blog)
Research already done — see `BENCHMARKING.md` (compiled 2026-06-15): which public benchmarks exist
(LoCoMo, LongMemEval, BEAM, MemBench, MemoryAgentBench, MemGym), how Mem0/Zep/Letta evaluate themselves
(with the known credibility disputes between them), a concrete LoCoMo-10 run plan, and a recommended
benchmarking order. No actual numbers have been produced yet — this section is genuinely unstarted,
but don't re-research from scratch, the plan already exists.
- [x] Latency — first real number, then fixed the biggest tail cost (2026-07-06). Initial measurement
      (15 `memory_retrieve` calls, live worker, ~4.6k-memory corpus, persistent HTTP/2 connection to
      isolate real server time from per-call handshake overhead): **p50=1.5s, p95=9.9s**. Root-caused
      the tail to `retrieval.ts`'s `domainSizeRows` query (`SELECT domain, COUNT(*) FROM memories
      GROUP BY domain`) — an unindexed full-table scan run on **every single retrieve call**, only
      used to set a confidence-floor threshold in `sharpenSigma` (tolerant of staleness). Fixed by
      cache-aside through KV with a 60s TTL (`getDomainSizeMap`, retrieval.ts) instead of hitting D1
      every call. Deployed and re-measured: **p50=1.4s (~6% down), p95=3.9s (~60% down)**. Not
      benchmarked against Mem0's API yet. p50 is still not fast for a "real-time" pitch — `retrieve()`
      still does ~6-8 D1/Vectorize/Workers-AI round trips per call (embed, vector query, FTS5, entity
      graph, cluster cohesion, candidate fetch, BFS hops) — but the worst-case is no longer ~10s.
- [x] **New bug found + fixed while chasing this (2026-07-06)**: the e2e sigma regression test failed
      deterministically (reproduced twice, not flaky) because `retrieve()`'s project scoping is
      `project = ? OR project = 'default'` — even the e2e suite's own unique test project always also
      searches real `default`-project data. Since `default` now contains extensive real dogfooding
      content about "Bayesian," "sharpen with reinforcement," etc., the freshly-stored test memory got
      crowded out / deduped against real higher-access-count memories instead of surfacing cleanly.
      Several *other* tests in the same file were only passing because their assertions didn't filter
      by the test's unique prefix and were silently matching real production content instead of the
      memory the test actually stored — a suite-wide false-confidence gap, not just the one failure.
      Fixed by switching the e2e fixtures (`TEXT_A`/`TEXT_B`) to topically unrelated synthetic content
      (penguin banding / synth repair) with zero real-world overlap, instead of Bayesian/Cloudflare
      content that collides with this project's own vocabulary — test-only change, zero production
      behavior change. Verified: full e2e suite (10/10) passes clean now.
- [x] **`OR project='default'` fallback — made opt-out instead of ripped out (2026-07-06)**: the fallback
      itself is genuinely useful for real callers (project-scoped agents still surfacing general
      identity/preference facts) so it stays the default — ripping it out would regress real usage just
      to fix test isolation. Added `strictProject` param to `retrieve()` (retrieval.ts) and `strict_project`
      to the `memory_retrieve` MCP tool (tools.ts) so a caller can opt a specific query out of the
      default-project blend for true isolation. Extracted `projectScopeClause()` since the same
      `project === 'default' ? '' : '...OR default'` logic was duplicated 3x in retrieval.ts (temporal
      fetch, main candidate fetch, BFS re-fetch) — centralizing it meant strict-mode support landed in
      all 3 at once instead of risking 2-of-3. Also declared `project` in the tool's inputSchema (was
      silently accepted but undocumented, same gap already flagged for `memory_timeline`'s `order`/`since`).
      e2e suite now passes `strict_project: true` on every retrieve call — real exercise of the new
      param, not just unit tests. Deployed + verified: 10/10 e2e pass, and ~30% faster (41s vs ~62-70s)
      since strict scoping means a smaller candidate pool to dedupe against.
- [ ] Token savings per call from caching (the resume-point metric)
- [x] Retrieval quality on a labeled query set — running since 2026-07-08 via
      `bench/ablation.mjs` against `bench/gold/retrieval_gold.{v1,vague,multihop}.json`
      (67 queries total). Current (post-`baa71a2`, 2026-07-17): recall 0.85
      main+multihop / 0.71 vague. See BENCHMARKING.md's 2026-07-23 session log for the
      latest register-miss follow-up (q33/q42/q36 fixed, q43/q44 still open).
- [ ] Identity coherence — 50 queries, LLM-judge whether injected context is coherent
- [ ] Association fidelity — 100 annotated pairs, BFS precision/recall
- [ ] Contradiction surface rate (lower = better)
- [ ] LoCoMo-style accuracy vs MemArchitect benchmark
- [ ] Reconstruction — how well injected memories reconstruct original context
- [x] **Scoring weights — applied and deployed (2026-07-07)** — `baseScore` (retrieval.ts:388)
      recency 0.22→0.27, access_freq 0.13→0.08 (cosine/BM25 unchanged). Targets the
      contradiction-ranking gap below (stale memories winning via access-count reinforcement).
      Lower cosine / raise BM25 still held off — no labeled recall/precision numbers to justify it.
      179 unit + 30 e2e pass post-deploy. Not yet measured against a labeled query set (no such set
      exists — see benchmarking items above); validated qualitatively via the contradiction fix below.

### Client Compatibility
- [x] Zed — confirmed 2026-07-05: `init` auto-merges a `context_servers` entry into
      `~/.config/zed/settings.json` (README:185-200), same auto-config tier as Claude Code.
- [x] Cursor / OpenCode — documented as broken upstream (README "Known gaps"), not a GM bug:
      Cursor's `sessionStart.additional_context` and OpenCode's `tool.execute.after` are both
      unwired in-runtime, linked to real upstream issue threads.
- [ ] Windsurf, Continue.dev — only a one-line "should work, plain JSON-RPC 2.0" claim in README
      (line 204), never actually verified against a running instance.
- [ ] OpenAI Codex/CLI — not mentioned in README at all yet.
- [ ] "Supported Clients" table in README once the above are confirmed

### Domain / cluster_id split — RESOLVED (2026-07-05)
Everything above this line (regrounding, anchor-merge, hybrid-gate, k-LLMmeans plans) is superseded and
removed — none of it shipped; it's preserved in git history (stashed, never merged) if ever needed for
reference. The actual fix ended up being architectural, not a better threshold: domain was doing two jobs
(human-facing named taxonomy + the signal retrieval depends on for dedup/diversity), and no amount of
threshold-tuning fixes a taxonomy job's instability from corrupting a retrieval-mechanics job. Split them:

- **domain** — unchanged, still the named/capped taxonomy for browsing + (now-abandoned) `/viz`. Full-corpus
  rebuild replaced with deterministic clustering (Fable's work, 2026-07-05): clusters raw embeddings first
  (order-independent average-linkage, no LLM in the grouping step), one LLM call per resulting cluster for
  naming only. Rerunning on the same corpus now reproduces the same domains — the original instability
  (15/31/49/6/50 across reruns) is gone. `clusterStep`'s O(k²) merge-trace computation crashed Workers'
  CPU budget around k~2100 micro-clusters (well under the naive 2500 safety cap, never load-tested) — bounded
  to the largest 500 clusters only (rebuild.ts, `MAX_MERGE_CANDIDATES`), small ones fold in via existing
  nearest-cluster-or-general logic. Rebuild tool works now; not urgent to ever run since day-to-day tagging
  isn't affected by any of this.
- **cluster_id** (new) — raw, unnamed, uncapped micro-cluster assignment, pure embedding math, no LLM,
  backed by a dedicated `MICRO_VECTORIZE` index (`src/microcluster.ts`). This is what `storage.ts`'s dedup
  gates and `retrieval.ts`'s diversity cap actually read now, instead of domain — confirmed via live testing
  (2026-07-05: verified a known 6-member near-duplicate cluster got correctly suppressed to ≤3 in real
  results). Domain mislabeling can no longer corrupt dedup or repetition control.
- [x] **`/viz` repointed to cluster_id, then abandoned as not worth further effort (2026-07-05)** — after
  3 rounds of tuning (label/placement density, dust/glow contrast, cosmic color palette + radial gradient)
  it still didn't look compelling. Purely cosmetic, not worth more time; left functional but unpolished.
- [ ] **Known minor gap, low priority**: `retrieval.ts`'s adaptive sigma floor (line ~40-44/527,
  `sharpenSigma`'s domain-size-based confidence floor) still reads `domain`, not `cluster_id` — the one
  retrieval-adjacent thing domain mislabeling can still quietly affect. Confirmed via live testing this does
  NOT cause wrong search results (tested 3 unrelated queries, only correct content surfaced) — it only nudges
  confidence scoring slightly. Two candidate fixes were considered and both rejected on real technical
  grounds: swapping to cluster_id count doesn't work (clusters are too fine-grained — nearly every memory
  would read as "sparse" since most clusters have 1-5 members); swapping to the memory's own access_count
  doesn't work either (already double-counted in baseScore's `normAccess` term — would create a rich-get-richer
  loop rewarding anything retrieved often, relevant or not). A live embedding-neighborhood-density check
  (looser similarity threshold than cluster_id's, computed at retrieval time) was proposed as a third option
  but not built — revisit only if real evidence shows this actually causing bad ranking, not preemptively.

### Contradiction detection — found gap, fixed + deployed (2026-07-07)
Live example: an old "domain rebuild still has major issues, don't trust this" memory kept surfacing
in retrieval alongside/instead of the newer "domain split resolved 2026-07-05" memory. Root cause —
`isContradiction()` (storage.ts:124-127) only fired on cosine≥0.88 **and** a negation-word regex
mismatch (`no longer`, `switched from`, `stopped using`, etc.) — built for preference-switch phrasing,
not status-flip phrasing ("issues" → "resolved"). Neither side hit the NEGATION regex, so no
`supersedes` relation ever got written, and the stale memory competed on equal footing at retrieval
time — if it had more `access_count` from repeated surfacing, it could outrank the correct, newer memory.
- [x] Widened `isContradiction` with a second class — `UNRESOLVED`/`RESOLVED` regex pairs
      (storage.ts:120-141) catch "still has issues"/"fixed"/"resolved"/"doesn't work" phrasing
      alongside the existing NEGATION check, each with its own cosine floor: NEGATION stays at
      0.88 (tuned/tested), the status class runs at 0.75. Two floors, not one, because status-flip
      pairs reword more than tool-switch pairs do ("switched from X" keeps "X" verbatim; "still has
      issues" → "now fixed" often shares little surface text) — first deploy at a shared 0.88 floor
      under-fired on a heavily-reworded real-phrasing test pair ("...don't trust the readings" →
      "...is now fixed and resolved") despite both sides clearing the regex; confirmed live
      afterward that dropping the status floor to 0.75 does fire `CONTRADICTION` on that exact pair.
      Safe to run lower specifically here because the class is already gated on both sides by
      curated vocabulary, unlike a bare cosine check. 24 unit tests (storage.test.ts). **Not yet
      checked for false positives** — two unrelated topics that each happen to use "fixed"/"still
      has issues" language could in principle collide above 0.75 cosine; no labeled set exists to
      rule this out (same gap as the cosine/BM25 retrieval question above). Worth a spot-check
      against real corpus diversity before trusting this broadly.
- [x] **Found + fixed a second, more serious bug while verifying live (2026-07-07):** `memory_judge`
      (tools.ts, `memory_relations` insert) always stored the `supersedes` relation as
      `(target → cand)`, but `target` is always the *older* side when pulled from the
      `contradiction_flag=1` auto-queue (storage.ts flags the older side at store time) — so the
      relation was stored backwards, and retrieval's `[SUPERSEDED]` tag (which reads `to_id` as "the
      replaced memory") landed on the surviving/correct memory instead of the stale one. `valid_to`
      expiry was unaffected (computed by timestamp, not relation direction) so the stale memory was
      still correctly excluded from results — but the survivor displayed as `[SUPERSEDED]`, exactly
      inverting the intended signal. Extracted `resolveSupersedeDirection()` (storage.ts) to always
      re-orient the relation to (newer → older) regardless of target/cand labeling; 3 unit tests.
      Also cleared `contradiction_flag` on the surviving memory after judging (was staying flagged
      forever, showing `[CONTRADICTED — re-evaluate]` even post-resolution). Verified end-to-end on
      a live isolated test pair: store → `CONTRADICTION` → `memory_judge` → correct `supersedes`
      direction confirmed via direct D1 query → `memory_retrieve` returns only the clean, current
      memory with no tag. Deployed; 179 unit + 30 e2e still pass.
- [x] **Multi-agent code review (2026-07-07, high effort) found 4 more real bugs, all fixed same
      day** — the review also found risks that were already disclosed above (generic-vocab false
      positives at 0.75) or turned out not to matter (target/cand direction issue for non-supersedes
      verdicts, currently harmless per retrieval's own reads); the 4 below were new and real:
  - `RESOLVED`'s bare `fixed`/`resolved` matched inside `UNRESOLVED`'s own "not fixed" phrase —
    two memories that both say "not fixed" (i.e. *agree*) were getting flagged as contradicting.
    Fixed with negative lookbehinds (storage.ts) on the bare alternatives; verified directly via
    node before and after. 5 new tests.
  - `isContradiction` was only ever checked against the single closest Vectorize candidate
    (`bestId`) — a closer non-contradicting candidate silently prevented a real, lower-cosine
    contradiction from ever being checked. Contradiction detection now scans all Vectorize
    candidates independently of the merge-selected `bestId` (storage.ts) — merge/dedup logic
    itself is untouched, still uses the single best candidate.
  - The cross-cluster ceiling (0.90/0.97, built for merge precision) was gating the contradiction
    check too, making the 0.75 status floor unreachable for any pair landing in different
    clusters — exactly the reworded pairs that floor exists for. Contradiction detection no
    longer goes through the merge ceiling (same edit as above).
  - `memory_judge`'s own `results.push()` log line unconditionally printed `target → cand`, which
    could diverge from the actual persisted direction once `resolveSupersedeDirection` reverses
    it — not fixed this pass (cosmetic/log-only, didn't affect stored data), tracked as a known
    minor gap.
- [x] **The real underlying gap — semantic distance, not thresholds (2026-07-07):** direct testing
      on the real "domain rebuild has issues" vs "domain/cluster_id split resolved" memories proved
      the actual problem was never the cosine floor — `memory_judge` at a 0.70 floor checking 10
      candidates never even considered the resolving memory a neighbor. Root cause: problem-language
      ("wildly different domain counts," "don't trust this") and fix-language ("cluster_id,"
      "deterministic clustering") are lexically distant even though a human sees the connection
      instantly. **Fix: added FTS5 keyword-match candidates alongside Vectorize cosine search**, in
      both `memory_judge` (tools.ts) and `storeMemory`'s write-time contradiction check (storage.ts)
      — merge/dedup deliberately does not see these, only contradiction detection does. No cosine
      floor applies to FTS5 candidates; shared vocabulary is the signal, the LLM verdict call is the
      precision gate, same as it already is for cosine-sourced candidates.
  - **Found and fixed a bug in this fix while verifying live**: the first version passed raw memory
    text directly as the FTS5 `MATCH` query. Confirmed via direct D1 query that real memory text
    throws FTS5 syntax errors (colons = column filter, plain commas tripped the parser on long
    text) — silently caught by the existing `.catch(() => [])`, so the FTS5 path was likely
    contributing zero candidates in practice. Also too restrictive even without erroring: FTS5's
    default is implicit AND between barewords, so a 70-word query needs literally every word
    present, i.e. never matches. Replaced with `buildKeywordQuery()` (storage.ts): tokenizes to
    alphanumeric words, drops stopwords/short words, sorts longest-first (first-N-in-sentence-order
    was tried first and cut real memories' significant words, which tend to appear mid/late-sentence
    on longer text), OR-joins quoted terms. Verified the exact generated query against live D1 with
    zero errors. 5 unit tests.
  - **Real end-to-end verification, not synthetic**: stored the actual true "domain rebuild resolved
    2026-07-05" fact into production (`default` project, `gaussian-memory` domain) — `CONTRADICTION`
    fired automatically at write time (no manual `memory_judge` call). Ran the nightly-cron-equivalent
    `memory_judge` sweep: found the pair via keyword match (`domain`, `rebuild`, `instability`),
    LLM judged `supersedes (98%)`, correctly oriented (newer → older) via `resolveSupersedeDirection`.
    Confirmed via direct D1 query: old memory now has `contradiction_flag=1, valid_to` set; new one
    is clean. Live `memory_retrieve` for "domain rebuild classifier instability issues" — the
    2-week-dominant stale memory is gone from top results entirely, replaced by the correct,
    current one. 194 unit + 30 e2e pass, all deployed.
  - **Scope note**: this closes the specific pair found this session, and the mechanism now exists
    for future pairs with real keyword overlap. It does not generalize to pairs sharing *zero*
    literal vocabulary (pure semantic/topical relation with no shared words) — that would need a
    different mechanism (e.g. LLM-based topic linking), out of scope for today.
- [x] **Fresh multi-agent review round 2 (2026-07-07) on the full expanded diff — 6 fixed, 3 noted
      as follow-up, 1 refuted**:
  - Fixed: `RESOLVED`'s negative lookbehinds only excluded a negator directly adjacent to
    "fixed"/"resolved" — "not yet fixed"/"never really resolved" (real, natural phrasing) defeated
    them. Widened to scan up to 3 words back; verified via node before/after, 5 new tests.
  - Fixed: `UNRESOLVED`'s article group only matched "an ", not "a " — "still has a major issue"
    (correct grammar, singular) silently failed to match. `(an )?` → `(an? )?`; verified + tests.
  - Fixed: `env.VECTORIZE.getByIds` in `storeMemory` had no `.catch()`, unlike the sibling FTS5
    query beside it — a transient Vectorize error would have hard-failed the entire write instead
    of degrading gracefully. Added the same catch-and-continue pattern.
  - Fixed: the FTS5 D1 query was awaited sequentially after Vectorize + KV recent-cache reads that
    don't depend on it — restructured all three into one `Promise.all`, removing an extra
    sequential round trip from every `storeMemory` call.
  - Fixed: dead `bestText`/`bestScore` state (left over from an earlier round's refactor, no
    longer read anywhere) and a redundant `matches.map(...)` + `new Set(...)` re-derivation when
    the already-built, already-unique `matchIds` could be spread directly.
  - Fixed: `getByIds` had no defensive cap to the documented 20-id limit (rebuild.ts's own
    established pattern) — was safe only by coincidence of an unrelated FTS `LIMIT 10` constant.
    Added `.slice(0, 20)`.
  - **Not fixed, noted as follow-up** (discretionary, larger scope):
    (1) `memory_judge`'s candidate set roughly doubles (Vectorize + FTS unioned, uncapped) with a
    sequential LLM call per candidate across up to 20 targets in the nightly cron sweep — real risk
    of the scheduled handler running long. (2) `storeMemory`'s added latency compounds in
    `memory_capture_passive` (≤20 sequential calls) and `memory_extract_and_store` (≤13) — both
    already latency-heavy from prior LLM calls in the same request. (3) Three independent
    hand-rolled "merge Vectorize + FTS5 candidates" implementations now exist (storeMemory,
    memory_judge, plus retrieval.ts's original) despite `rrfMerge` (retrieval.ts) already solving
    this generically — worth extracting into one shared helper.
  - **Refuted**: a finding that `memory_judge`'s FTS candidates carry no cosine score (unlike
    `storeMemory`'s) — confirmed by reading the code that `memory_judge` never consumes a score
    downstream at all (pure LLM judgment, no `isContradiction` call), so this divergence has no
    functional effect there.
  - 198 unit + 30 e2e pass, deployed.

- [ ] One-time prune of old verbatim noise in the pool (pre-distillation junk: "Yeah, I do." etc.) — for clean demo retrievals

- [ ] Blog post — outline exists (`../blog_post_outline.md`, 123 lines, "Reconstructive Memory for
      AI Agents") but the post itself is unwritten. Path was stale (said Downloads/, actually lives
      one directory up from this repo) — fixed 2026-07-06.

### Quality / Testing
- [x] E2E coverage for remaining tools (2026-07-06) — added tests for `memory_auto_store`,
      `memory_extract_and_store`, `memory_store_decision`, `memory_store_diff`, `memory_list`,
      `memory_timeline`, `memory_belief_drift`/`backfill`, `memory_orphan_check`, `memory_judge`,
      `memory_capture_passive`, `memory_update`, `memory_delete`, `identity_profile_get` (read-only).
      Deliberately skipped: `identity_profile_set` (single shared production KV key, no test
      isolation — would clobber the real profile), `memory_rebuild_domains`/`memory_retag_projects`/
      `memory_build_entities` (corpus-wide mutations against real production data, no dry-run
      path for two of the three). 30/30 e2e tests pass, confirmed on 2 consecutive clean runs.
      Found and fixed 2 real production bugs while writing these (both deployed live):
      (1) `memory_store_diff`'s GLM-4.7-flash quality-gate call (tools.ts) had no timeout guard,
      unlike sibling `memory_auto_store` — confirmed live via `wrangler tail` that it can hang
      long enough for the Workers runtime to cancel the request outright (status "Canceled"),
      silently dropping the diff with no response ever returned. This tool fires on every
      Bash/Write via the PostToolUse hook, so this was a live reliability gap. Fixed with
      `Promise.race` + 12s timeout, defaulting to SKIP on timeout.
      (2) `memory_bulk_delete` only supported text-pattern matching, not project filtering, even
      though every store call accepts and persists a project. Since `memory_extract_and_store`
      and `memory_store_diff` both LLM-rewrite/paraphrase input text, their stored output often
      retains no literal substring from the original text, making pattern-based test cleanup
      silently miss it — this left a permanent `tidewater-kite-club` domain (6+ rows) polluting
      the real production corpus from earlier test runs, which then broke test determinism by
      colliding (cosine-similarity merge) with a later run's fresh store. Manually cleaned up the
      leftover rows; fixed `memory_bulk_delete` to accept an optional `project` param (exact
      match, AND-able with `pattern`); updated e2e's `afterAll` to clean up by project instead of
      pattern, which is reliable regardless of LLM rewriting.
      Also found and fixed a 3rd, test-only bug: `findMemoryId`-style lookups via `memory_list`
      are fundamentally fragile two ways — `memory_list` truncates displayed text to 80 chars
      (so a snippet late in a long TEST_PREFIX-prefixed string can never appear in output,
      regardless of retries — not a timing issue, a display truncation), and a global
      `since`-only search with no domain filter competes against this account's real ambient
      write volume and can genuinely evict an entry from even a 500-row window over a
      multi-minute suite run. Redesigned as `findLatestMemoryId(domain)`: resolves the single
      newest row in a known domain (no text matching at all), called immediately after each
      store while that row is still guaranteed to be the newest — sidesteps both failure modes.
- [x] Retrieval edge case tests (2026-07-06) — empty query, whitespace-only query, domain param
      (soft boost not hard filter), `synthesize=true`, temporal cue (`today`), and capitalized
      entity-token boost, all against the live `retrieve()` pipeline (not unit-mockable given the
      D1/Vectorize/AI dependencies).
- [x] `microcluster.test.ts` existed but wasn't wired into `npm test` — fixed (2026-07-06), was silently never running
- [x] Unit tests for `src/domain.ts` (2026-07-06) — `domain.test.ts`, 16 tests covering `deriveAnchorName` + `bestAnchor`.
      Found 2 real (minor) bugs while writing these, both fixed same day (2026-07-06): (1) the fallback-pass
      regex stripped uppercase letters instead of case-folding, so a capitalized stop-listed word reaching that
      pass got corrupted (e.g. "Session" → "ession") instead of being matched or skipped — fixed by lowercasing
      before stripping (domain.ts:43); (2) `bestAnchor`'s `bestSim` started at -1 with a strict `>` compare, so
      a lone anchor at exactly sim=-1 returned `null` instead of that anchor — fixed by using `-Infinity` as the
      sentinel (domain.ts:64). Tests updated to pin the corrected behavior. Ran a multi-angle code review on
      this whole diff after (2026-07-06): correctness angles found nothing; cleanup findings led to a shared
      `normalizeToken()` helper in `deriveAnchorName` (was 3 independently-written passes, same bug class could
      have recurred), consolidating `gaussian.ts`'s `cosine()` to delegate to `embed.ts`'s `dotProduct()` (was
      two copies of the same math), and parameterizing `dedupBySimilarity`'s thresholds + `sigmaGate`'s
      floor/multiplier (were hardcoded, inconsistent with `applyDiversityCap`'s style) — with tests added that
      actually exercise the new parameters.
- [x] Unit tests for `src/retrieval.ts` (2026-07-06) — extracted the pure pieces (`rrfMerge`, `minMaxNormalize`,
      `tokenize`/`jaccardSimilarity`/`dedupBySimilarity`, `sigmaGate`, `applyDiversityCap`) out of the monolithic
      `retrieve()` into named exports (behavior-preserving refactor, verified via typecheck + full e2e-adjacent
      test pass), then added `retrieval.test.ts`, 32 tests. The BFS/spreading-activation score combination
      itself is still untested at unit level — it's entangled with live Vectorize calls inside the hop loop;
      e2e is still the right coverage tool for that part.
- [x] Unit tests for `src/storage.ts` contradiction detection (2026-07-06) — exported `isContradiction` and
      `normalizeForExactMatch` (was an inline arrow fn), added `storage.test.ts`, 12 tests. Kalman merge math
      itself was already covered by `gaussian.test.ts` (storage.ts just calls `kalmanMerge`, doesn't reimplement
      it). The spawn/merge/contradiction *branching* in `storeMemory` remains untested at unit level — it's
      inline D1/Vectorize/KV calls, would need a mocked `Env` to isolate; not attempted this pass.
- [x] Clean up dead code in `extensions/browser/inject.js` — confirmed 2026-07-05: `GM_TOOLS`/`GM_TOOL_NAMES`/`injectGMTools()`/`injectToolResults()` don't exist anywhere in the repo (removed in commit `38f3c7c`, part of the 2026-06-17 session); this item was just never checked off
- [x] Fixed duplicate-POST bug: guarded `tapClaudeStream` (tee failure returns raw response, never re-fetches) + explicit return in Claude catch for pre-dispatch errors (2026-06-17)
- [x] Fixed double-store: `captureChatGPTSSE` now stores the turn exactly once via a `stored` flag / `flush()` ([DONE] or stream end) (2026-06-17)

### Polish
- [ ] Platform import (`npx gaussian-memory import --from mem0`)

---

## Priority 2 — Reach (post-July)

### Browser extension — memory in consumer web LLMs
- [x] Claude.ai — working (context-inject + turn capture via extract_and_store; tools dropped, they hung the chat UI)
- [x] ChatGPT — working (context-inject + both-direction capture; verified live 2026-06-17)
- [x] Unified both platforms on the extract/distill path (clean facts, not verbatim) — verified
- [ ] Gemini — HARDER (probed 2026-06-17): (1) uses **XHR not fetch** → must also wrap
      XMLHttpRequest.open/send; (2) prompt in URL-encoded **nested-array f.req** (protobuf-ish),
      parse-by-position + re-encode. Real build, not a quick port. "Coming soon" for launch.
- [ ] Chrome Web Store submission (or document "load unpacked" for dev-audience launch)

### Agent affordances — tool descriptions as skill docs — DONE (2026-07-06)
MCP tools had mechanical descriptions (what, not when). For an MCP server consumed by agents, tool descriptions
ARE the skill docs — the only non-optional surface the agent reads every turn. Rewrote all 21 non-trivial tool
descriptions in `tools.ts` to teach when/why, not just what, deployed and verified live via `tools/list`:
- `memory_retrieve` ↔ `memory_list` ↔ `memory_timeline` now cross-reference each other explicitly (topical
  search vs recency/audit vs chronological), so the model reaches for the right one instead of defaulting to
  `memory_retrieve` for everything.
- `memory_store` / `memory_auto_store` now state the domain mis-tagging tradeoff directly, telling the model
  when to pay the extra explicit-domain cost vs use the convenience path.
- Maintenance-only tools (`memory_judge`, `memory_dedupe`, `memory_cleanup_singletons`, `memory_rebuild_domains`,
  `memory_retag_projects`, `memory_build_entities`, `memory_belief_drift_backfill`, `memory_extract_and_store`)
  now explicitly say "not typically called mid-conversation" so a model doesn't reach for them spontaneously.
- The `memory_timeline` "all rows stamped the same backfill date" bug referenced here previously is stale —
  confirmed 2026-07-06 the handler already does `ORDER BY timestamp DESC` correctly; that data-layer issue was
  fixed at some prior point without this TODO entry being updated.
- Not done: the separate "paste-in CLAUDE.md in npm docs for clients that ignore MCP instructions" idea — still
  open, low priority, since MCP tool descriptions (now fixed) cover the primary surface every client reads.

### Be the memory layer for frameworks
- [ ] Vendor-neutral adapter so any agent framework (incl. eve) can use GM as its memory
- [ ] Universal hooks: normalize agent events to a common schema (portable, not Vercel-locked)

### Self-improvement loop — outcome→behavior (Brain parity, added 2026-06-20)
Perplexity Brain (launched 2026-06-18) closes a record→reflect-overnight→improve-execution loop
(+25% on repeated tasks). GM today is record→retrieve. We already store agent activity (episodic
session summaries, `memory_store_decision` {decision,context,alternatives,outcome}) — the missing
wire is outcome→retrieval-priority. Mechanism (reuses existing Bayesian machinery):
- [ ] **Log retrievals:** new D1 table `retrieval_log {session_id, query, retrieved_ids[], scores[], ts}`
      — without this there's no way to attribute outcomes back to memories.
- [ ] **Harvest reward (sparse, strong signals only):** explicit = `store_decision.outcome` + in-session
      corrections; implicit = reuse `belief_drift` — contradicted memory = negative, reinforced = positive.
- [ ] **Nightly reflect pass (Cron Trigger — same job as the decay/cleanup cron):** give each memory a
      Beta(α,β) utility belief; helped-in-good-session → α++, present-in-corrected → β++. Existing
      sigma/sharpness encodes confidence in utility. Pass also does dedup/supersede/decay (one job).
- [ ] **Feed back into scorer:** `baseScore = 0.6·cos + 0.25·recency + 0.15·freq + w_u·utility[m]`
      → misleading memories suppressed even when cosine-similar, reliable ones boosted. Closed loop.
- Gotchas: weak credit assignment (update on strong signals only, not every session); rich-get-richer
  (keep ε exploration floor + recency/cosine for cold start); reward sparsity (converges slowly).
- ~2–3 focused sessions; reuses log + belief_drift + cron + Bayesian scorer already built.

### Hosted (optional, later)
- [ ] DO-hosted version (per-user isolation, free beta → $1–2/month) — only if BYOC demand justifies it
- [ ] Rebrand (Mnemo taken, need new name)

## Done (2026-06-17)
- Domain rebuild — 5,244 memories cleanly classified into 17 real domains (no garbage)
- D3 `/viz` galaxy — every memory as a point, Gaussian clouds per domain; Twitter-demo-ready
- Browser extension: ChatGPT support + unified distillation path + dropped hanging Claude tools
- Killed P2 "Agent OS" roadmap (eve owns it); refocused thesis on the memory layer
- Diagnosed decay: fires but too gentle to prune (flat additive, not time-aware) → see DO TOMORROW

## Dropped (eve owns this — not worth building solo)
- ~~Agent OS: state checkpointing, inter-agent messaging, DO orchestration, model routing, sandboxed compute~~
  (Vercel eve does all of it; the moat is memory, which eve lacks.)
